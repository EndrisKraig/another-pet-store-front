# Intro

This is front part of another pet store project. The purpose of this project is to try out new language and its features.

# Getting started

This is a typical react app builded from create-react-app command. At the moment the only working branch is **develop**.

1. Check out this project to your working machine
2. Navigate to source dir
3. npm install node-sass --save
4. npm i
5. npm start

Thats it. If the server is up and already got some data then most likely you can see the project in browser (default address http://localhost:3000). Otherwise outcome is unpredictable. Reliability is still in backlog.

# Features to implement

+ Don't fail on server error responses
+ Mock data endpoint
+ Do a proper pagination
+ Create a home page
+ Testing
+ Improve design of pages
+ ? Find a better way to create .css files e.g. without *.module.css
+ More to come, stay tuned
